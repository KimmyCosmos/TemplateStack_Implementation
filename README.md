# Template Stack Implementation (C++)

This project implements a stack using C++ templates and a fixed-size array. The stack supports standard operations such as `push`, `pop`, `top`, `empty`, and a custom `pop_two` method for removing the top two elements. Exception handling is included to manage operations on empty or full stacks. This project was completed as part of a data structures and algorithms course.

## Technologies
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Key concepts
- Template classes
- Stack data structure
- Fixed-size array implementation
- Exception handling for error conditions

## How to compile and run

### Compile
```
g++ main.cpp -o template_stack
```

### Run
```
./template_stack
```

## What I learned
- Building type-generic data structures with templates
- Managing dynamic stack operations using a fixed-size array
- Implementing exception handling for robustness
